## Summary

I'm a software engineer with nine years of experience in professional software development. I've been leading a remote dev team for more than three years now. As a senior backend developer, I've built a backend for API driven B2B systems and workflow automation.

I see myself as a "playing coach" in the team, not only the man who leads but the man who plays.

My master's degree in CS (FEFU) and years of experience gave me a deep understanding of web technologies, protocols, algorithms and data structures.

I'm proficient with a modern development process and well experienced in practices: Agile, VCS, TDD, Continuous Integration \ Delivery. So I prefer to build a system from scratch: designing architecture, selecting stack, setting up a workflow for the team and config the deployment process.

I know how to create beautiful and reliable RestAPI's, scalable and maintainable systems according to KISS, SOLID, DRY principles. I believe the programming – it is about complexity control that's why I always remember: code should be written for people, not for machines.

I'm a big fan of Continuous Integration ideas, public Clouds and the "fearless-programming" concept. So, I pay huge attention to quality-gates, automation of linting, formatting, testing and good coverage for my projects. This is especially important for remote teams.

Programming is my passion, and I wonder the academic side of the question as well. I am still inspired by the ideas of McConnell, Fowler, and Gang of Four. I like "Clean Architect | Code | Coder" concepts and I believe if you have to to write OOP code, it should be a simple and clean one.

Lately I'm passionate about in functional programming, and from time to time like to solve some problems by Haskell just for fun.

I'm looking for ways to master my skills, so regularly attend global conferences, meetups. Also, I've taken part in the local dev community [VLDC](https://vldc.org/).
